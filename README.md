Hi, it seems that WorldRemit app that I used to send you the payment is no longer accepting payments to Nigeria. Do you know another app? ![image](https://github.com/bloominspo/floragreensprouts/assets/149491836/e01a1927-e174-4a0a-a79e-9fcf4235d212)

You can use MoneyGram or World Remit. I apologize for the inconvenience. ** Please Ignore this **

Okay I'll try MoneyGram, WorldRemit is actually having the issue (the screenshot is from WorldRemit app)

Unfortunately, you cannot transfer to my dollar account anymore. I will give you an account to transfer to, the details are below:
Account Name: Nosa Clement Obasuyi
Account Number: 2064417411
Bank Name: United Bank for Africa(UBA)

The destination currency will now be Naira not Dollar. Hence, you are to select Nigeria NGN. Then input the dollar amount you want to send it. 

You can continue with World Remit. It will work this time, just use the new account details provided above.

Hi, I've sent the payment, let me know once you've received it
