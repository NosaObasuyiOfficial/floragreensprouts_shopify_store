Hi, it seems that WorldRemit app that I used to send you the payment is no longer accepting payments to Nigeria. Do you know another app? ![image](https://github.com/bloominspo/floragreensprouts/assets/149491836/e01a1927-e174-4a0a-a79e-9fcf4235d212)

You can use MoneyGram or World Remit. I apologize for the inconvenience. ** Please Ignore this **

Unfortunately, you cannot transfer to my dollar account anymore. I will give you an account to transfer to, the details are below:
Account Name: Nosa Clement Obasuyi
Account Number: 2064417411
Bank Name: United Bank for Africa(UBA)
